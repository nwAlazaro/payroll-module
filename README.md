# Payroll Module (Simulated Project)

This is a backend module for calculating employee payroll in a simulated HR or financial system.  
It was built using ASP.NET Core and follows clean code and SOLID principles.

## 📌 Features

- Calculates net payroll based on base salary, bonus, and tax rate.
- Exposes a REST API endpoint for payroll calculation.
- Organized into Models, Controllers, and Services using dependency injection.
- Easy to extend and integrate into larger systems.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- .NET Core
- C#
- ASP.NET Web API
- Dependency Injection
- Entity Framework Core (placeholder for DB)
- Swagger (suggested for API testing)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
PayrollModule/
├── Controllers/
│   └── PayrollController.cs
├── Models/
│   └── Employee.cs
├── Services/
│   └── PayrollService.cs
```

## 🚀 How to Run (Conceptual Example)

1. Clone the repository
2. Add to a new ASP.NET Core Web API project
3. Register `IPayrollService` and `PayrollService` in `Startup.cs`
4. Use Swagger or Postman to test the endpoint:
   ```
   POST /api/payroll/calculate
   {
       "name": "Alice",
       "baseSalary": 3000,
       "bonus": 500,
       "taxRate": 0.15
   }
   ```

## 📄 Note

This is a simulated project created for portfolio demonstration purposes. It does not contain business-sensitive or proprietary code.
